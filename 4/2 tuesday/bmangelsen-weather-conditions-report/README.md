# **Weather Report**
This Ruby application pulls data from multiple Weather Underground API endpoints and presents a weather report to the user when desired zip code is entered. Each type of report is held in its own class, along with test suite. Queries were used to validate tests, rather than continually pulling down API endpoints from Weather Underground.
